## Introduction

I recently participated in a CTF after not having attempted one for a bit. I
wanted to brush up on skills related to developing secure web applications.
Despite starting late and working into the early morning, I placed
in the top 17% of participants, with 1232 total points. I'd like to review my 
work and maybe could be a resource for future CTF participants. 

## The Challenges

I finished a number of challenges, titled thusly:

- YSON
- Nine-One-Sixteen
- Finders Keepers
- Rusty
- Jott
- Unhackable Andy
- Back the Hawks
- Repo Recon

Some I feel like I made significant progress on, but got stuck and shifted to
another problem to finish as many as I could. I took the tactic I believe
is suggested for students taking the SAT: if a problem is taking too much time,
move on and revisit when possible.

- Quick Maths
- Color Profile
- Unhackable Andy II

## YSON

YSON was a challenge using an existing library to exploit a conversion from YAML to JSON.
This challenge required a specific escape sequence to, as I would put it, jailbreak
out of the process and execute arbitrary commands.

## Geminas namque quod referitur argenteus aderat superstes

Insistere pugno. Cum morae vigilantibus dulces Cycnus: neque cum sororis.

Hac Aestas solet docebo tandem tamquam omnis vitiantur mitte, vatis in animique
infelix passimque. Superasset onus.
